CS50 Problem Set 1 Smart Water

A. Water
Write a program that asks the user for the duration of his/her shower in minutes.
The program should then print the hypothetical equivalent number of water bottles used during the shower. 
Assumption: user will input a positive integer; no need to check for errors, loops, or overflow. 

B. Itsa Mario
Write a program that recreates a half-pyramid using hashes (#) for blocks. 
1. Prompt the user for the half-pyramid’s height, a non-negative integer no greater than 23. 
2. If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than 23, you should re-prompt for the same again. 
3. Then, generate (with the help of printf and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid. 
4. Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window

C. Time for Change
Write a program that first asks the user how much change is owed 
and then spits out the minimum number of coins with which said change can be made.
